Cold Turkey is an app to block websites, games, and applications to boost productivity and reclaim free time.

**To trigger an existing block:**

  block (hours) (block name(s))

**To add an URL to an existing block:**

  urlblock (block name) (url)

**Blocking all links with certain string:**

  The * character represents any text. If you want to block all websites with "unicorn" in the URL, you could add *unicorn* to the block. If you only want to block Google searches for "unicorn" you could add: google.com/*q=*unicorn*
